# Basic-Restful-Web-Service
Basic Restful Web Service Using Java Spring Boot and Green Lake Cloud Platform 
In this project I Wrote a proposal for a RESTful web service to manage a list of employees.
I also Built a web server application in Java Spring Boot that can accept and respond to HTTP requests as well as support uploading JSON data.
Finally I Developed and ran a set of unit tests to assess my Java Spring Boot applicationâ€™s performance.
